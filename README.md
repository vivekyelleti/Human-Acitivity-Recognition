# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning-based human activity recognition (HAR) model implemented using PyTorch, integrated with a Streamlit web application for image-based activity prediction. The model can classify various human activities from input images and is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

# Features

Pre-trained Deep Learning Model: Uses a PyTorch model to predict human activities from uploaded images.

Streamlit Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

Customizable Architecture: Easily adaptable to other deep learning architectures for human activity recognition.

Image Processing Pipeline: Resizes and normalizes images for compatibility with the model.
